        <h1>Green Revival</h1>
        <p class="intro">
           Barcelona and its surrounding area has been suffering from a prolonged drought for over 2 years. In February 2024, when regional reservoirs, some of which critically supply Barcelona and its metropolitan area, were at less than 15%, the regional government introduced the phase of state of Emergency due to drought. This meant harsh water restrictions for supply, use, and farming. And of course, the landscape of the area was also affected.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            However, starting around late February and March, it occasionaly started raining, and later on, there were many intense rain storms in Barcelona and the surrounding regions. This, combined with the shift of the seasons towards spring, has resulted in an incredible green revival of the landscape of Catalonia, which I have captured, mostly though informal photography, showing what just a little (and later a lot) of rain can do. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            Recently, the state of emergency has been removed, though the region still finds itself in the lower levels of restrictions. Just like climate change in general, we don't really know what will happen in the future with the climate of Catalonia. But, as I've certainly been shown, there is hope.
